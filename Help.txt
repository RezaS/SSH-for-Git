1. git ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your-email@example.com"
2. eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
3. ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
4. For Windows: clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   For OS X: cat id_rsa.pub | pbcopy
   For Linux: cat id_rsa.pub | xclip
   (or just simply copy the content of the file id_rsa.pub)
5. Go to your GitHub Account -> New SSH Key -> Paste from the clipboard -> Save
6. git push origin master (only for the first time)

Hint: SSH Key name is not needed. Just hit enter.
Hint: Using a password is not needed but recommented.
Hint: If you get an error after the first push command, just try: git push --set-upstream origin master
